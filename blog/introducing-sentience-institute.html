Our mission is to build on the body of evidence for how to most effectively expand humanity&rsquo;s moral circle, and to encourage advocates to make use of that evidence.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Because the scope of this mission is so large, we&rsquo;re initially focusing on effective strategies to increase concern (in attitudes and in policy) for farmed animals. There are big changes happening in this field, such as the </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/why-are-us-corporate-cage-free-campaigns-succeeding">recent wave of corporate cage-free reforms</a></span><span>&nbsp;and the development of new </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="http://www.sfchronicle.com/meat/">animal-free foods</a></span><span>&nbsp;like the Impossible Burger. The farmed animal advocacy movement has a significant demand for strategic research as indicated by the </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ace-2016-year-in-review-rgb.pdf">rapid growth</a></span><span>&nbsp;of Animal Charity Evaluators</span><span>, the contributions of </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="http://www.openphilanthropy.org/giving/grants?field_focus_area_target_id_selective%3D531">tens of millions of dollars</a></span><span>&nbsp;by the Open Philanthropy Project, and the evidence-based approach of leading nonprofit organizations in the space like </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/mercy-for-animals/">Mercy For Animals</a></span><span>&nbsp;and the </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/humane-society-of-the-united-states-farm-animal-protection-campaign/">Humane Society of the United States</a></span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Our two founding staff (Executive Director Kelly Witwicki and Research Director Jacy Reese) previously worked for </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="http://sentience-politics.org/de">Sentience Politics</a></span><span class="c1">, a project of the Effective Altruism Foundation (EAF). Sentience Politics worked in three areas: research, movement-building, and political initiatives, and is now splitting into two independent organizations (i.e. no longer part of EAF), one continuing under the name of Sentience Politics and running political initiatives in the German-speaking area, and the other SI.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">SI is collaborating heavily with others in the effective animal advocacy (EAA) field to maximize the usefulness of our research. We expect to fill the niche of expanding the foundational evidence base in EAA with a strong focus on intellectual rigor and an emphasis on far future impact. We don&rsquo;t plan to conduct charity evaluations or spend much time directly moving money to effective organizations, but instead will create research content that can be used to inform that work and advocacy decisions, such as randomized controlled trials, literature reviews of fields like anti-smoking and voter turnout advocacy, and case studies of social movements like British anti-slavery and environmentalism.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Our first completed project is our </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="http://sentienceinstitute.org/foundational-questions-summaries">Summary of Evidence for Foundational Questions in Effective Animal Advocacy</a></span><span>, which aggregates the foundational research in this field and will be updated with new research results. This will help us track and prioritize research projects, as well as communicate research results with impact-focused advocates.

Our two co-founders regularly give talks on effective animal advocacy, primarily for university students and at conferences. Kelly is speaking at Effective Altruism Global: Boston, and Jacy will be speaking at the 2017 Animal Rights National Conference this fall. Jacy might also give a TEDx talk this fall. Jacy is currently writing a book on </span><span class="c4 c9"><a class="c5" href="http://jacyreese.com">The End of Animal Farming</a></span><span class="c1">, and its launch will involve op-eds and other forms of outreach.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>We will also post research updates and summaries on our blog, and are running Facebook and Twitter pages. As we expand our outreach efforts, we might eventually create career content such as an EAA job board and career profiles similar to those published by </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in other effective altruism cause areas.</span></p><h4 class="c7" id="h.qmsrcc9y8tyu"><span class="c3">Self-evaluation</span></h4><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We&rsquo;re committed to evaluating our own efforts and changing directions or even disbanding the organization if we determine that we can make a greater impact elsewhere. If our research fails to generate new, actionable insights that make a significant difference to advocates&rsquo; decisions, we plan to shift our priorities towards outreach and movement-building, such as the career content described above. Or if we do generate new, actionable insights but feel that advocates are neglecting the cost-effective strategies those insights point to, we will consider pursuing them ourselves.</span></p><h4 class="c7" id="h.4keerw42qihm"><span class="c3">Research standards</span></h4><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We will strive to maintain the best possible research standards, such as preregistering our randomized controlled trials and seeking out peer review on all our research, mostly from other people who study EAA but also from other experts when possible, such as a social movement&rsquo;s historian for a case study on that movement. Additionally, we plan to stay up-to-date on the latest research and expert opinions on research standards so we can update our methods accordingly.</span></p><h4 class="c7" id="h.howtd1ts6cw0"><span class="c3">Transparency</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>We also plan to publish financial records, internal policies, regular updates, and a Mistakes page similar to those of </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="http://www.givewell.org/about/our-mistakes">GiveWell</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4"><a class="c5" href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/about/transparency/corrections/">Animal Charity Evaluators</a></span><span class="c1">. We&rsquo;re committed to building a collaborative environment so we can help advocates, donors, researchers, and everyone in the effective animal advocacy community.</span></p><h4 class="c7" id="h.gj3rtaeeq0ck"><span class="c3">Finances</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>The Effective Altruism Foundation has granted SI $60,000 to cover our initial costs and all expenses through December. Once we&rsquo;ve raised $2</span><span>3</span><span class="c1">,000, we&rsquo;ll start interviews for a third team member so we can conduct more research. (We have some promising candidates in mind.) Funding beyond that will enable us to run several polls and surveys, costing approximately $1,000-5,000 each, and will secure salaries beyond our first half year. If we are able to raise over $100,000 in the near future, we could make a fourth hire, run more polls and surveys, and conduct more outreach. We are also open to restricted funding from excited donors for specific purposes such as increasing salaries to more competitive rates to attract top talent, creating EAA career content, or conducting research focused specifically on wild animals.</span></p></body></html> </div> <hr> <div class="container newsletter-container"> <p>Subscribe to our monthly newsletter to receive updates on our research and activities.</p> <div id="mc_embed_signup"> <form action="//sentienceinstitute.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=d898f823d035e0601866e68d6&amp;id=cbf2d915a6" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" class="validate" target="_blank" novalidate> <div id="mc_embed_signup_scroll"> <input type="email" value="" name="EMAIL" class="email form-input" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Email address" required> <!-- real people should not fill this in and expect good things - do not remove this or risk form bot signups--> <div style="position:absolute;left:-5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_d898f823d035e0601866e68d6_cbf2d915a6" tabindex="-1" value=""></div> <div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" class="button"></div> </div> </form> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="donate-container"> <a class="button donate-button" href="https://app.effectivealtruism.org/donations/new?utm_source=sentience-institute&utm_medium=partner_charity&utm_campaign=partner_charity_donations&allocation%5Bsentience-institute%5D=100"> Donate to Sentience Institute through Effective Altruism Funds </a> </div> <footer class="footer"> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-2"> <div class="bold">Contact us:</div> <div><a href="mailto:info@sentienceinstitute.org">info@sentienceinstitute.org</a></div> <div class="icons"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sentienceinstitute"><img class="icon" src="../img/icons/icon_facebook_white.png"></a> <a href="https://www.twitter.com/sentienceinst"><img class="icon" src="../img/icons/icon_twitter_white.png"></a> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-10 last-column"> <div> © 2017 Sentience Institute </div> <div> <a href="/terms">Terms and Conditions &amp; Privacy Policy</a> </div> <div> Thank you, <a href="http://weanimals.org/">Jo-Anne McArthur</a>, for granting us the use of so many photos. </div> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <!-- Bootstrap core JavaScript
