The evidence herein will not satisfy any desire for scientific proof. (We discuss this in more detail in </span><span class="c25"><a class="c2" href="http://sentienceinstitute.org/blog/ANoteonSpeculationandIntuitionasEvidence">this blog post</a></span><span class="c11">.)</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c21 c16"><span class="c11">This post includes evidence that EAA researchers think is strongest: anecdotes and intuition, speculation, social movement trends, psychology findings, marketing findings, animal advocacy experiments, and any other information that makes one hypothesis more likely to be true than another. We provide citations when possible, usually to EAA discussions though sometimes to outside resources. Most uncited arguments have already been discussed in casual EAA conversation.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c21 c16"><span>We attempt to categorize each piece of evidence into the side of the debate that a significant majority of EAA researchers agree it supports.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c11">&nbsp;Where there is less agreement, or when the evidence&rsquo;s direction depends largely on other questions in this document, it will be noted as pointing in an &ldquo;unclear direction.&rdquo; We also note when there seems to be significant majority agreement among EAA researchers on which side of the overall debate is most likely correct. Note that this does not mean it&rsquo;s highly likely to be correct, just that it seems most compelling given the current evidence. The three questions with that level of agreement are:</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c11"></span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_n7blg0fpsipr-0 start"><li class="c6"><span class="c11">Individual vs. institutional interventions and messaging (favoring institutional interventions and messaging)</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c11">Momentum vs. complacency from welfare reforms (favoring momentum from welfare reforms)</span></li><li class="c6"><span class="c11">Animal protection vs. environmental vs. human health focus (favoring animal protection focus)</span></li></ul><p class="c8"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c21 c16"><span class="c11">Advocates can, of course, take a moderate position between the sides of the debates addressed in this document, and the composition of the animal advocacy movement might need some advocates taking different approaches. This document discusses what approach seems most promising on the margin, e.g. with a new $1,000 donation to the movement.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c21 c16"><span class="c11">It&rsquo;s useful to evaluate movement-wide strategy on the margin, but individual advocates should keep in mind that contexts (e.g. country, time period, resources) vary significantly and are often a crucial factor in individual situations. For example, if you are an established climate activist who now wants to focus on helping animals, you might want to focus more on environmental arguments than the average advocate does because that is where your expertise is and you might have disproportionate influence on environmentalist audiences.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c21 c16"><span class="c11">This document is intended as a living reference, where ideas for further research are logged, new evidence can be added, and additional important questions can be discussed. We will try to update it as frequently as possible. Eventually, researchers in the field could add their own quantitative weights to different arguments so we can have more precise debates and updates of our individual views based on peer opinion.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c21 c16"><span>The primary purpose of this document is as a secondary EAA resource, meaning we will cite existing EAA research when possible instead of outside sources. Because many EAA discussions happen via in-person conferences and meetings, social media, and email and other private communication, we will inevitably use some sources from outside EAA. When a theoretical argument is uncited in the text, you can assume that it is from unpublished discussions within the EAA community. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c21 c16"><span>Before publishing this page in June 2017, we asked for feedback from </span><span>1</span><span>5 individuals who we selected based on (i) the amount of time we estimate they have spent thinking critically about these questions and (ii) our estimate of how independently they came to their views, e.g. we avoided asking too many people who work at the same organizations.

It seems advocacy could make a crucial difference in whether they will occur, so a major portion of the expected impact of funding programs that achieve these outcomes comes from the possibility that the change would never happen otherwise. For example, it seems unclear whether society will replace animal agriculture with cultured meat, given the technology develops, and that additional funding could substantially increase the likelihood this replacement occurs. In this way, social change affects the direction of the future.<br><br>Technological change that is physically possible, on the other hand, seems likely to eventually occur even without our intervention. It seems that humans in modern society work towards technological progress for a variety of reasons like helping others, personal curiosity, and commercial profit. This, combined with the fact that backwards technological progress seems quite uncommon, unlike backwards social progress, suggests that when we fund technological progress, the primary mechanism of impact is speeding up new technologies rather than causing them to exist when they otherwise never would.
